1. Loosely coupled and tightly coupled
2. Make a loosely coupled JAVA program for making DAO(Data Access Object) POJO Class.
For this make a Interface which contains the CRUD
(Create/Read/Update/Delete) methods . And then make three classes which implements the interface for CRUD with OracleDAO class, MySQLDAO class and the PosGresDAO class. Consume DAO in Loosley Coupled Manner.
3. Implementation of singleton and prototype in beans
4. Implementation of Injections: Constructor, Setter
5. Injection in classes by Value, by Object refrence 
6. Loan Origination System implementation
7. If you dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean and vice-versa what will be happen.
8. Collection Injection: LIST,SET,MAP
9. Implementation of DB Factory
10. Implement Loosely Coupled app using Annotation.
11. Setup of a Maven Project in Spring framework
12. Implementation of autowiring: ByType, ByName
Create two classes A &B and do the DI of A with B using ByType. Create another class C and do its DI with A using ByName. Create one more class i.e. Caller class which is main class of the application
13. Implementation Aspect-Oriented Programming in spring applications to enable modularization in transaction management.
